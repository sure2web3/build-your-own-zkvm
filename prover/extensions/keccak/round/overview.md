| component.rs             | File      | Defines the **Keccak round component**, encapsulating the logic and algebraic constraints for a single round of the Keccak permutation. This file ensures that each round of the Keccak hash function is modeled correctly in the proof system, including the transformation of state variables and the application of round-specific operations.                                                      |
| constants.rs             | File      | Contains **constants** used in Keccak rounds, such as round constants, rotation offsets, and other fixed parameters required by the Keccak permutation. These constants are essential for ensuring that each round of the hash function behaves according to the Keccak specification and that the proof system can validate the correct use of these values.                                         |
| constraints.rs           | File      | Defines the **algebraic constraints** for the Keccak round function. This file ensures that all state transitions and operations within each round (such as theta, rho, pi, chi, and iota steps) are performed correctly and are faithfully represented in the execution trace. These constraints are crucial for the soundness and security of Keccak hashing in zero-knowledge proofs.                  |
| eval.rs                  | File      | Implements the **evaluation logic** for Keccak rounds, used during trace construction and constraint checking. This file provides the algorithms and routines for computing the intermediate and final state of the Keccak permutation, supporting both proof generation and verification.                                                                   |
| interaction_trace.rs     | File      | Handles the **interaction trace** for Keccak rounds, which records intermediate state and interactions between different steps of the Keccak permutation. This trace data is used to optimize proof generation and to ensure that all dependencies and transitions between rounds are correctly captured and validated in the proof system.                                                    |
| mod.rs                   | File      | The main **module file** for the `round` directory. It organizes and re-exports all logic related to Keccak rounds, providing a unified interface for integration with the rest of the Keccak extension and the overall proof system. This modular structure supports maintainability and extensibility of round-based cryptographic operations.                                                    |
| trace.rs                 | File      | Implements the **trace logic** for Keccak rounds. This file records the state transitions and intermediate values at each step of the Keccak permutation, ensuring that all relevant data is captured in the execution trace for proof generation and verification. The trace logic is essential for enforcing round constraints and supporting efficient cryptographic proofs.                         |
