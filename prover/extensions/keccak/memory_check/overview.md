| constraints.rs           | File      | Defines the algebraic constraints for Keccak memory checks. This file ensures that all memory accesses related to Keccak operations (such as reads and writes during hashing) are valid, consistent, and follow the expected access patterns. These constraints are crucial for maintaining the integrity and soundness of cryptographic computations within the zero-knowledge proof system.                                      |
| mod.rs                   | File      | The main module file for the `memory_check` directory. It organizes and re-exports all logic related to Keccak memory checks, providing a unified interface for integration with the rest of the Keccak extension and the overall proof system. This modular structure supports maintainability and extensibility of memory access validation for cryptographic operations.                                  |
| trace.rs                 | File      | Implements the trace logic for Keccak memory checks. This file records the state and sequence of memory accesses during Keccak operations, ensuring that all relevant memory interactions are faithfully captured in the execution trace for proof generation and verification. This trace data is essential for enforcing memory-related constraints and supporting efficient cryptographic proofs.         |
