| mod.rs      | File      | The main module file for the `bit_rotate` directory. It implements and organizes logic for bit rotation operations used in the Keccak hash function. Bit rotations are a core part of the Keccak permutation, and this file provides the algebraic constraints and trace logic to model them efficiently and correctly in the zero-knowledge proof system. By modularizing bit rotation logic, the prover can easily integrate and reuse these operations across different Keccak-related constraints. |
