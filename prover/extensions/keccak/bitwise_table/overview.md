| constraints.rs              | File      | Defines the algebraic constraints for the Keccak bitwise lookup table. This file ensures that all bitwise operations (such as AND, OR, XOR, NOT) performed as part of the Keccak permutation are correctly represented and validated in the execution trace. These constraints are crucial for the soundness and efficiency of Keccak hashing within the zero-knowledge proof system.                                                        |
| mod.rs                      | File      | The main module file for the `bitwise_table` directory. It organizes and re-exports all logic related to the Keccak bitwise lookup table, providing a unified interface for integration with the rest of the Keccak extension and the overall proof system. This modular structure supports maintainability and extensibility of bitwise operation support.                                                |
| preprocessed_columns.rs     | File      | Handles the definition and management of preprocessed columns for the Keccak bitwise table. Preprocessed columns are auxiliary data structures that optimize the evaluation of bitwise constraints and improve proof generation performance. This file ensures that all necessary precomputed values are available and correctly linked to the trace.                                                |
| trace.rs                    | File      | Implements the trace logic for the Keccak bitwise table. This file records the state and results of bitwise operations at each step of the Keccak permutation, ensuring that all bitwise computations are faithfully captured in the execution trace for proof generation and verification.                                                                  |
