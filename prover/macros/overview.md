| Cargo.toml        | File      | The manifest file for the `macros` subcrate. It specifies dependencies, crate metadata, and build configuration for procedural macros used in the prover system. This file ensures that the macros can be built and integrated independently from the main prover crate, supporting modular development and reuse.                                                  |
| src/              | Directory | Contains the source code for procedural macros that automate code generation for trace columns, enums, and constraint definitions. These macros help reduce boilerplate, enforce consistency, and prevent errors in the definition of trace-related structures, making the prover codebase more maintainable and scalable as the number of instructions and constraints grows.                                  |
| src/column_enum.rs| File      | Implements a procedural macro for generating Rust enums and associated code for trace columns. This macro automates the creation of enum variants and related methods, ensuring that trace columns are defined consistently and efficiently across the prover system. It simplifies the process of managing large numbers of trace columns and reduces manual coding effort.                                 |
| src/lib.rs        | File      | The main entry point for the `macros` crate. It declares and exports all procedural macros defined in the subcrate, making them available for use throughout the prover codebase. This file organizes macro definitions and ensures they are properly registered with the Rust compiler for code generation tasks.                                                    |
