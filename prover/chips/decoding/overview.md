| mod.rs            | File      | The main module file for the `decoding` directory. It organizes and re-exports all instruction decoding chips, providing a unified interface for decoding logic. This modular structure allows the prover to easily manage and extend support for different instruction formats.                                                                               |
| type_b.rs         | File      | Implements constraints for decoding **B-type** (branch) instructions (e.g., `beq`, `bne`). B-type instructions are used for conditional branching and encode two source registers and an immediate value that determines the branch target. The decoding logic ensures correct extraction of operands and immediate, and that the trace reflects valid branch instruction formats.                        |
| type_i.rs         | File      | Implements constraints for decoding **I-type** (immediate) instructions (e.g., `addi`, `lw`). I-type instructions are used for immediate operations and loads, encoding one source register, one destination register, and an immediate value. The decoding chip ensures correct parsing of these fields and validates the instruction format in the trace.                                              |
| type_j.rs         | File      | Implements constraints for decoding **J-type** (jump) instructions (e.g., `jal`). J-type instructions are used for jumps and encode a destination register and a 20-bit immediate for the jump target. The decoding logic extracts the jump target and destination register, ensuring the trace matches the RISC-V J-type encoding.                                                                |
| type_r.rs         | File      | Implements constraints for decoding **R-type** (register-to-register) instructions (e.g., `add`, `sub`). R-type instructions encode two source registers and one destination register, used for arithmetic and logical operations. The decoding chip ensures correct extraction of all register fields and validates the instruction format in the trace.                                               |
| type_s.rs         | File      | Implements constraints for decoding **S-type** (store) instructions (e.g., `sw`). S-type instructions are used for store operations, encoding two source registers and an immediate value that together specify the memory address and data to store. The decoding logic ensures correct operand and immediate extraction and validates the S-type instruction format.                                 |
| type_sys.rs       | File      | Implements constraints for decoding system instructions, which handle privileged or environment-related operations. This chip ensures that system instructions are correctly interpreted and that the trace reflects valid system instruction formats and operand extraction.                                                                                 |
| type_u.rs         | File      | Implements constraints for decoding **U-type** (upper immediate) instructions (e.g., `lui`, `auipc`). U-type instructions encode a destination register and a 20-bit immediate value, used for loading large constants. The decoding chip extracts these fields and ensures the trace matches the RISC-V U-type encoding.                                            |
