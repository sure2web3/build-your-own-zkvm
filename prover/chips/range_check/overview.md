| mod.rs            | File      | The main module file for the `range_check` directory. It organizes and re-exports all range check chips, providing a unified interface for range checking logic. This modular structure allows the prover to easily manage and extend support for different types of range checks within the proof system.                                                      |
| range_bool.rs     | File      | Implements constraints for **boolean range checks**. This file ensures that certain values in the trace are strictly 0 or 1, which is essential for enforcing boolean logic and binary flags in the VM state. Boolean range checks are widely used for conditionals, selectors, and bit-level operations.                                                        |
| range8.rs         | File      | Implements constraints for **8-bit range checks**. This file ensures that specific values in the trace fit within the range of an 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 255). Such checks are important for byte-level operations, memory accesses, and enforcing correct data widths in the VM.                                                                       |
| range16.rs        | File      | Implements constraints for **16-bit range checks**. This file ensures that values fit within the range of a 16-bit unsigned integer (0 to 65,535). These checks are used for halfword operations, address calculations, and enforcing correct operand sizes in the VM.                                                                                      |
| range32.rs        | File      | Implements constraints for **32-bit range checks**. This file ensures that values fit within the range of a 32-bit unsigned integer (0 to 4,294,967,295). 32-bit range checks are crucial for word-level operations, register values, and memory addressing in a 32-bit VM architecture.                                                                  |
| range128.rs       | File      | Implements constraints for **128-bit range checks**. This file ensures that values fit within the range of a 128-bit unsigned integer, supporting large integer operations, cryptographic primitives, and advanced arithmetic in the VM.                                                                                                                  |
| range256.rs       | File      | Implements constraints for **256-bit range checks**. This file ensures that values fit within the range of a 256-bit unsigned integer, which is especially important for cryptographic operations (such as elliptic curve or hash computations) and for supporting large data types in the VM.                                                           |
