| mod.rs                     | File      | The main module file for the `memory_check` directory. It organizes and re-exports all memory check chips, providing a unified interface for memory consistency logic. This modular structure allows the prover to easily manage and extend support for different types of memory checks within the proof system.                                                                                                                           |
| program_mem_check.rs       | File      | Implements constraints for **program memory consistency checks**. This file ensures that the program code loaded into memory remains consistent throughout execution, preventing unauthorized modifications. It enforces that all instruction fetches and code accesses in the trace correspond to the original program, which is essential for soundness and security in zero-knowledge proofs.                                           |
| register_mem_check.rs      | File      | Implements constraints for **register memory consistency checks**. This file ensures that register values are updated and accessed correctly throughout the execution trace. It enforces correct register read/write operations, preventing invalid or out-of-order updates, and supports the integrity of the VM's register file in the proof system.                                                 |
| timestamp.rs               | File      | Implements logic for **timestamping memory operations**. This file tracks the order and timing of memory accesses (reads and writes) in the execution trace, ensuring that memory operations occur in a valid and consistent sequence. Timestamping is crucial for detecting and preventing issues like double-spending, race conditions, or invalid memory reuse in the proof system.                                                   |
